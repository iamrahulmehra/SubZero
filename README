## 📖 About
**SubZero** is an AI-powered financial utility designed to stop "subscription leakage." It solves the problem of forgotten free trials and recurring "zombie" charges that drain personal finances.

By analyzing transaction data (via SMS alerts or bank statement PDFs) using OCR and pattern recognition, SubZero identifies recurring payment intervals, flags unused subscriptions, and provides a direct path to cancellation.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Zombie Detection:** automatically flags payments occurring at specific intervals (e.g., every 30 days) that haven't been opened or used.
* **OCR Parsing:** Uses Tesseract/Google Vision to read non-digital bank statements (PDFs/Images).
* **Financial Health Score:** specific score based on your ratio of essential vs. non-essential recurring payments.
* **One-Click Cancel:** (Planned) Direct links to the specific "unsubscribe" pages of major services.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **OCR/AI:** Tesseract OCR (or EasyOCR)
* **Frontend:** React (or Streamlit for rapid prototyping)
